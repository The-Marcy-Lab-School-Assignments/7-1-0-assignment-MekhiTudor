# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

Create a context folder and import the `useContext` Hook into our folder. We have to set `createContext` to a variable with a base in its `()`. We then have to wrap out application in the context provider we just created and set out context values in our object. This was we can safely pass down data through the children of the provider (which is our app).

Solid! And how would we retrieve the values from the context?
